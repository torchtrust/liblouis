The liblouis developer team is proud to announce the liblouis release
3.0.0. The release is available for download at:

    https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases

Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages[1].
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and
is used by screenreaders such as NVDA, Orca and JAWS. A companion
project liblouisutdml[2] deals with formatting of braille.

Changes in this release
=======================

This is the biggest release of liblouis in years. The major news are
that we now have proper support for UEB and secondly that liblouis is
now licensed under LGPLv2.1+.

In order to support UEB the internals of liblouis have seen a major
rewrite. New Opcodes have been added to support the requirements for
proper UEB for example for emphasis handling or to handle proper
translation of numbers. Changes to the opcodes are described in the
documentation. Some of these changes are not backwards compatible. All
tables that come with liblouis have been migrated. If you have private
tables look at the section on upgrading from previous versions in the
wiki[3].

This release also changes the C API. External applications will have
to adapt the way they call liblouis. In particular the typeform
parameter has changed.

The license of the library and most of the tables has been changed to
LGPLv2.1. For a detailed list which tables are still in the process of
migrating the license refer to the wiki page about the license
change[4].
